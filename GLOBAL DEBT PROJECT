What if understanding global debt trends could reveal the financial future of nations?

Excited to Share My Latest Data Analytics Project on Global Debt with Quantum Analytics NG! üåç

As part of my work with Quantum Analytics NG, I developed an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of Global Debt Trends across various financial metrics. The goal was to simplify complex data into a clear, user friendly visualization for better decisionmaking.



 Data Extraction and Transformation  
To create this insightful dashboard, I carried out extensive data extraction and transformation processes as well as data modeling. The dataset was refined to uncover key trends and actionable insights.



 Dashboard Features:
 Slicers: Enabled country level exploration for tailored insights.  
 Key KPIs Tracked:
   Countries with Financial Debt  
   Countries with Household Debt  
   Countries with Central Government Debt  
   Countries with General Government Debt  



 Key Insights:

1. Household Debt (20002009):  
    Household debt saw significant growth across 84 countries, reflecting increased financial liabilities during this period.

2. Bottom 20 Countries with Private Debt (20102019):  
    Countries like Thailand, Spain, and Ghana had relatively low private debt, indicating limited borrowing in these regions.

3. Top 10 Countries with NonFinancial Debt (20002009):  
    High nonfinancial debt was observed in Austria, Israel, Canada, and Finland, pointing to considerable debt outside the financial sector.

4. Top General Government Debt (20002009):  
    The United States topped the list, with general government debt ranging from $23B to $64B. Other highdebt nations included the UK, UAE, and Venezuela.

5. Central Government Debt (20012010):  
    The United States led with $52B in debt, followed by Venezuela. Countries like Vietnam, Yemen, and Zimbabwe also showed significant debt accumulation.

6. Regional Debt Disparities:  
    A stark contrast exists between countries with high and low debt levels, showcasing varying financial strategies and economic capacities globally.



 Final Thoughts:  
This dashboard not only highlights global debt trends but also provides a foundation for strategic financial planning and policymaking. It emphasizes the need for balanced debt management across sectors and regions.
